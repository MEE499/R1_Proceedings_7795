MAC/PHY layer

Radio waves and infrared have been studied to give medium support to IVCs. The 
radio  waves  include  micro,  millimeter  and  VHF  waves.  The  communication  with 
millimeter  waves  and 
infrared  are  usually  directional,  while  VHF  is  used  for 
broadcast.  The  typical  r
adio  bandwidth  used  in  IVC  is  5.9  GHz  in  US,  5.8  GHz  in 
Japan and 5.8 GHz in Europe.
The FleetNet project  chose  ULTRA TDD due to the availability  of the unlicensed 
frequency band 2010
-
2020 MHz in Europe. Most projects, however, have adopted the 
use of inf
rared (CarTALK, COOPER
, JSK, PAT
H...).
There are two approaches in developing MAC for IVCs. One is using IEEE 802.11 
as  a  radio  interface,  while  the  other  consists  on  extended  3G  technology,  such  as 
CDMA  for  distributed  access.  Both  of  them  have  to  be  mod
ified  and  adapted  to 
provide  an  efficient  solution  for  IVCs.  The  advantage  of  using  IEEE  802.11  is  the 
inherited support for distributed coordination in ad hoc mode. On the other hand, 3G 
extensions present high granularity for data transmission.

Almost all routing protocols used by the different IVC projects are position
-
based. 
In  addition,  existing  MAC  ad  hoc  protocols  could  be  directly  applied.  But  if  an 
optimal  performance  is  desired  taking  into  account  the  linear nature  of  the  networ
ks 
seen in section III
, modification of the existing routing protocols must be performed.
In  addition,  the  features  most  of  vehicles  offer  nowadays  makes  possible  to  get 
position information via GPS or GIS, very useful for routing. The protocol in section
VI uses a forwarding scheme which avoids beacons for im
