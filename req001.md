## Introduction

Nowadays , the culture of hybrid, all-electronic S.M.A.R.T. and connected autonomous vehicles is on an ever-peaking demand-curve. This also means an extension of the vehicle-security exploitaions increment we hear about through daily media, about theft, hijacking or simply vandallism. Such an overwhelming need for an automobiles' security and longevity can only be met by the far-reaching, impactful and tailored technology, suited for the respective scenario.
Realizing such endeavours could be only possible owing to the O.S.S. collective, and thence garnered resources and source codes.
In account of solving this research conquest, such an approach has been applied, in order to be able to cater the needs of almost everyone with a direct contact with a vehicle, or any automobile, public, personal or even private.
We, through the medium of this project, would aspire to address such vehicle optimization adversing security related tradeoffs, and conclusively suggest remedies.
